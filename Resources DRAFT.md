# Resources

Over the past few years, I have compiled a collection of links to essays, articles, online libraries, databases, lectures, music channels, all ranging from the mainstream to the more obscure and eclectic. My aim is to organize them for my own reference and to share them with the public. It is updated regularly.

### Recommended Essays (as of April, 2025)

[The Translation Wars](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/the-translation-wars) A must-read for anyone interested in Russian literature and the nuances of translating Russian literary classics into English.

On a related note, I am often asked, *"What is the best translation of Dostoevsky/Tolstoy's works?"* P&V is fine; though I personally much prefer Michael Katz’s translations above all others.

[Reflections on Love and Suffering](https://traversingtradition.com/2023/03/13/reflections-on-love-and-suffering/) A beautifully written essay by a dear friend that discusses the nature of love and suffering and the relationship between divine and worldly love in the Islamic tradition.

[Evola on Religion and Sex](https://ormulus.substack.com/p/religion-and-sex) A short and thought-provoking article examining how different world traditions approach the subject of sex. Worth reading regardless of your opinion of Evola.
