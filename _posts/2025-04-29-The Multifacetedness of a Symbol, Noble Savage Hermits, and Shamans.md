There is one persistent misconception in the mind of a modern man, a belief that a spiritual or religious interpretation of a given symbol is, by nature, mutually exclusive to a historical or materialist one. The origin of this assumption is almost never examined, though it likely stems from the habit of viewing the material as being locked in fundamental conflict with the spiritual. It's either/or, rarely both.

This same sentiment, of course, manifests in other ways, in sayings like, "there are no true mystics left in the world, and if any exist, they are hiding in caves, not wasting time on the internet", which reveals, at best, a sort of naïve idealism (and, at worst, paternalism). What is held sacred here is not the mystic himself, but the idea, *the image* of what a mystic is supposed to be, a noble savage-hermit who belongs in the abode of yesterday. It is in that abode of yesterday that the mystic or shaman must remain; a living artifact to be studied, but never fully engaged with as equal. *Lappen ska vara Lapp; Eremiten ska vara eremit.* All of this, of course, is false dualism, born of a mind that cannot see beyond the frigid surface appearances of multiplicity.

It reminds me of a funny episode from the past. Many years ago, we went to see a shaman. In Buryatia, the shamans do not withdraw from society like some mysterious forest druids; they live ordinary lives and work regular jobs. They can be doctors, teachers, police officers, businessmen, civil servants, and so on. With the revival of shamanism in the public sphere after the collapse of the USSR, they have since established their own organizations and temples. This particular shaman worked as a government clerk.

He came outside to greet us, an ordinary-looking, middle-aged man. The house he lived in was a standard Russian wooden home some 40-min ride away from the city center. The only things in his home that hinted at anything unusual were a few accessories: a drum, a headdress, and *ongon* figurines on the wall.

At some point, my sister-in-law asked him, "So, how come you decided to become a shaman?"
He laughed and replied, "It's not like we have a choice."

What he meant was that spirits do not simply vanish because humans dismiss them as relics of the past. In Buryat, and more broadly, Siberian shamanism, there is a phenomenon known as "shamanic illness." A man or woman, typically in their 40s (though sometimes younger), undergoes a sudden onset of illness or a life crisis. They may fall sick, lose loved ones, experience madness, visions or hallucinations, hear voices, suffer from strange dreams, or fall into depression. This period can last for months and even years, until they are invited, in a dream, to accept the calling of a shaman and undergo initiation. If they accept, the initiation ceremony begins; if they refuse, the spirits take their revenge. Revenge  takes many forms, but more often than not, it culminates in the death of the person or that of a close family member.

Such was the environment I grew up in. It wasn’t until later in life, after I moved away, that I realized this entire way of life strikes some as an anachronism. In hindsight, however, it was precisely my life in Buryatia that taught me how the exoteric and esoteric can coexist within a society and, on a more microcosmic level, within an individual.

But coming back to the symbols — a symbol, by its nature, contains a multitude of meanings, of low and high orders, literal and abstract. The correct way to look at it is as a superimposition of layers. An exoteric interpretation of a symbol does not automatically invalidate the esoteric one, and vice versa. Symbolism is inherent to nature, and nature itself amounts to no more than a symbol of the transcendent realities, echoing the verses of the Quran: _“We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth”(41:53)_ and _“Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding.” (3:190-191)_

A symbol can operate on a purely intellectual level, a moral or psychological level, and a metaphysical or divine level. Guénon's in _The Symbolism of the Cross_ presents perhaps the most thorough exploration of this idea; he examines the Cross as the universal symbol which can be interpreted on multiple levels of abstraction. I will be publishing my notes on this subject here incrementally, and may revisit this little blog entry later, but for now, it stands as is.
