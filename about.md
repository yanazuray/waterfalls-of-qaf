I'm Yana, a 3D designer and artist from Buryatia, Russia. Iâ€™m interested in Islamic mysticism, the anthropology of Siberian peoples, Russian literature, and the history of religion and sacred traditions. You can find some of my essays on [**Waterfalls of Qaf**](https://waterfallsofqaf.substack.com/).
