# About

I am Yana, a 3D designer and artist from Buryatia, Russia. 

I work in animation, but I am also interested in exploring adjacent fields such as visual arts, installation, and immersive media.

Alongside my professional work, I spend much of my time to researching the history and mystical traditions of Islam, as well as the histories of Siberia and its peoples across past, present, and future.

I publish my personal reflections and essays on mysticism at [**Waterfalls of Qaf**](https://waterfallsofqaf.substack.com/) and [here].

My Siberian Aesthetics account: [@mythosiberia](https://x.com/mythosiberia)

I spend most of my time between Toronto, London, and my hometown, Ulan-Ude.
