# About

I'm Yana, a 3D designer and artist from Buryatia, Russia. 

I am interested in Islamic mysticism, the anthropology of Siberian peoples, Russian literature, and the history of religion and sacred traditions.

I speak Russian, English, and a bit of Buryat.

You can find my essays on [**Waterfalls of Qaf**](https://waterfallsofqaf.substack.com/) and here.
